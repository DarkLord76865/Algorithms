## Sieve of Atkin

The **Sieve of Atkin** is a modern algorithm for finding all prime numbers
up to a specified integer. Compared with the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, which marks
off multiples of primes, the sieve of Atkin does some preliminary work and then marks
off multiples of squares of primes, thus achieving a better theoretical asymptotic
complexity. It was created in 2003 by A. O. L. Atkin and Daniel J. Bernstein.
