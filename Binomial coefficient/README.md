## Binomial coefficient

The **binomial coefficients** are the positive integers that occur as coefficients in the binomial theorem.
Commonly, a binomial coefficient is indexed by a pair of integers n ≥ k ≥ 0 and is written $\binom {n}{k}$.
It can be calculated as $\binom {n}{k}={\frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!}}$.

Arranging the numbers $\binom {n}{0}$, $\binom {n}{1}$, $\ldots$ , $\binom {n}{n}$ in successive rows for n = 0, 1, 2, ... gives a triangular array called Pascal's triangle,
satisfying the recurrence relation $\binom {n}{k}={\binom {n-1}{k-1}}+{\binom {n-1}{k}}$.

The binomial coefficients occur in many areas of mathematics, and especially in combinatorics. The symbol $\binom {n}{k}$ is usually read as "n choose k" because there are $\binom {n}{k}$ ways to choose an (unordered) subset of k elements from a fixed set of n elements.
For example, there are $\binom {4}{2}=6$ ways to choose 2 elements from {1, 2, 3, 4}, namely {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4} and {3, 4}.
