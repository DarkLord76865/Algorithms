## Euclidean algorithm

**Euclidean algorithm** or **Euclid's algorithm**, is an efficient method for
computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers (numbers),
the largest number that divides them both without a remainder.
It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, who first described it
in his Elements (300 BC). It is an example of an algorithm, a step-by-step
procedure for performing a calculation according to well-defined rules,
and is one of the oldest algorithms in common use. It can be used to reduce
fractions to their simplest form, and is a part of many other number-theoretic
and cryptographic calculations.
